# E-commerce Inventory Cleanup

This inventory cleanup script allows me to quickly assess all items in inventory. Depending on attributes like Amazon Sales Rank, length of time on the shelf, and price, I can determine which items need removal.

The program exports one file with locator codes of the inventory items to be removed, and a second file to import into the inventory management system in order to remove the items from the inventory database.

This script has been tailored to work with the Monsoon Commerce inventory management software.
