# Inventory Cleanup Program

This inventory cleanup program helps the user to quickly assess which inventory items should be removed depending on Sales Rank, how long the item has been listed for, and price. It exports one file with locator codes of the inventory items to be removed, and a second file to import into an inventory manager to remove the items from the database.

This program is tailored to work with the Monsoon Commerce inventory manager.
