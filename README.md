# Inventory Cleanup Program

This inventory cleanup program helps me to quickly assess which inventory items should be removed depending on the Amazon Sales Rank, how long the item has been listed for, and price. It exports one file with locator codes of the inventory items to be removed, and a second file to import into the inventory management software in order to remove the items from the inventory database.

This program has been tailored to work with the Monsoon Commerce inventory manager.
